Enhanced Approach Using Memoization (Dynamic Programming).
We can enhance the propsed code by using memoization, which avoids recalculating Fibonacci numbers by storing the already computed values in an array.
This approach is particularly beneficial for large values of n, improving the efficiency of the algorithm.
This time complexity for this solution is O(n).
